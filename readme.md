## Description

This course is an introduction to the foundations behind modern data analysis
and machine learning.  The first part of the course covers selected topics from
probability theory and linear algebra that are key components of modern data
analysis. Next, we cover multivariate statistical techniques for dimensionality
reduction, regression, and classification. Finally, we survey recent topics in
machine learning, in particular, deep neural networks.
